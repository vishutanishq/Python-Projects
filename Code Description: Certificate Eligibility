This Python script is a basic "Certificate Eligibility" project that evaluates whether a user is eligible for certification based on multiple criteria. It follows a step-by-step verification process with user inputs to decide the eligibility. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

Project Introduction:

The program begins by printing a title to introduce the purpose of the project.
The title clearly states that it is a "Certificate Eligibility" project.
Class Attendance Check:

The user is asked whether they attended all the classes.
Input options: 1 for Yes, 2 for No.
If the user attended (input 1), it moves to the next step. If not (input 2), they are declared ineligible. Any other input is marked as invalid.
Assignment Completion Check:

After the class attendance check, the user is asked if they completed their assignment.
Input options: 1 for Yes, 2 for No.
If the assignment is completed (input 1), the next check is conducted. Otherwise, the user is marked ineligible.
Live Classes Check:

The program then asks whether the user attended daily live classes.
Input options: 1 for Yes, 2 for No.
A correct response (input 1) moves the user forward; otherwise, they are deemed ineligible.
Camera On Check:

Finally, the program asks if the user's camera was on during live classes.
Input options: 1 for Yes, 2 for No.
If the camera was on (input 1), the user proceeds; otherwise, they become ineligible.
Final Confirmation:

If the user successfully passes all checks, a final page is printed congratulating them for being eligible for the certificate.
The user is prompted to enter their name for the certificate.
Certificate Display:

The script generates a simple certificate with the user's name, showing the successful completion of a Python class from specific dates (e.g., 18-09-2023 to 22-09-2023).
A final "Thank you" message is printed.
Code Author Credit:

The code is credited to "Tanishq Kr Vishwakarma" at various points throughout the program.
